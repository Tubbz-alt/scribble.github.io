== Getting Started with Scribble.

----
module examples;

global protocol HelloWorld(role Me, role World) {
	hello(Greetings) from Me to World;
	choice at World {
		goodMorning(Compliments) from World to Me;
	} or {
		goodAfternoon(Salutations) from World to Me;
	}
}
----

A very simply example, but this illustrates the basic syntax for a hello world interaction, where a party performing the role Me sends a message of type Greetings to another party performing the role 'World', who subsequently makes a decision which determines which path of the choice will be followed, resulting in a GoodMorning or GoodAfternoon message being exchanged.
