module DuplicateLabels;

// This example should be supported by session types merging,
// but is not currently supported by Scala session classes generation
// due to a message label M that occurs twice in different contexts.
// Possible solutions:
//   1. rename one of the two M() messages;
//   2. relax the correspondence between message labels and Scala class names.
// 
// NOTE: it should be one of the examples supported by session types merging,
//       but not supported by vanilla Scribble
